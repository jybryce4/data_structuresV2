# Data Structures v2.0
![abstract image of nodes](data_abstract_header.jpg)
*A new and improved version of my 2019 data structures project*
## Project Description 
Welcome to the github repository for my Data Structures
Project! In this project, I will be attempting to
implement common data structures using modern C++. I
will continually improve upon these implementations and
use several major programming paradigms. 
Most notably, I will be using *generic programming* (with
templates) because my project is inspired by the Standard 
Template Library (STL).

I will use as many modern conventions as I can to make my code as clean as possible. 
The first major improvement will be in that I am placing everything in separate
namespaces. The second is that I will be using *smart pointers* whenever pointers
are needed. The third major improvement is that I will not use structs and instead
use classes. 

### Current
- linked list (in progress)
### Planned
- dynamic array
- sorted list
- stack
- queue
- binary search tree
- heap
- hash table

## Possible expansions
In addition to common data structures, I might make my
own implementations of common algorithms as well.

I am also considering creating custom iterators for my
data structures.

## Project Goals
A fully-functional library of data structures that I have
implemented. Not to replace the STL, but so that I can learn
how to be a better programmer.
